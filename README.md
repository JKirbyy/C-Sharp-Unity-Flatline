# C-Sharp-Unity-Flatline
A top down shooter created in the Unity game engine with C#. Includes my proudest programming moment in which I used speed = distance/time
to ensure that a group of enemies, that are meant to circle the player, all reach the player at the same time. The largest script is
DifficultyManager which allows the game to played forever by managing the spawns etc. of the enemies.
